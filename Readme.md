npm init is a command-line instruction used to create a package. json file for a Node. js package. The package. json file stores metadata and dependencies for your package, 
allowing you to easily manage and share your project with others.

if we create an empty folder then github ignore it so if we want to track this empty folder also we can use .gitkeep file 
mainly this type of folders are created so that we can store images or other data in it - if 3rd party does not word so we can take data from our server 

.gitignore - gitignore generator - node
